### DRIVER SCRIPTS

This repo contains R and Python bridge scripts to extract data contained in a [MindmapsDB](https://mindmaps.io) graph DB to be used with data science tools. 

These are just quick and dirty scripts, provided as a proof-of-concept and should not be used in production.

Remember to set the path to your MindmapsDB installation before using these scripts.
